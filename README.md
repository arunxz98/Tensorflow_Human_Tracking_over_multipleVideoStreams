# Tensorflow_Human_Tracking_over_multipleVideoStreams

The code is to provide a Proof of concept to track detect and track different humans in multiple video streams.

Since the project is a POC the latency of the models performance has been ignored. Please use a GPU for better performance.

This project is highly reliant of Siamese Networks. And the code has been inspired from multiple opensources.
